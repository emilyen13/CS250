How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I think it is important to listen to the requests the the user, and provide enough detail in the story so that the developer has an idea of what the client desires. Stories should have enough detail that the client's desires are being communicated, but also leave enough room for developer interpretation. Ultimately while it is important to create what the client wants, the developer also has a unique view of the product and should have influence as well.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The course of action I have found works best for me is breaking down programs/projects into small pieces, and then working on completing each piece. This was some I learned I needed to do early on in my computer science journey, as to not overwhelm myself when it comes to larger projects. Only through this class did I realize I was essentially creating little stories for myself. In the future I know I need to be better at testing as I go. For some reason when I get in a groove, I just get caught up writing code and believing it should work and then I get way too far along with no real idea as to why I am getting errors. I love that agile works that in to the process, and I need to do the same.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think to be a good team member is to feel comfortable with those you are working with. It is important to feel comfortable not only asking questions and for help, but also offering aid when you see a team member has been stuck on a task or story. Agile depends on good commuincation practices to suceed, however good communication is a vital skill for all work flows, not just agile.
